# sortable

Makes any table with class="sortable", er, sortable.

Works for ajax generated content.

Requires thead and tbody.

Just include the js and css and it will work. No function calls needed, all is done with an eventListener.

For Huge tables (>1000rows) it will be slow of course. That's just life I guess.
